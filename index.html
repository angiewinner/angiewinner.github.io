        Angelika Winner<br><span style="font-size:20px;">Urban Geographer for Social Justice</h1>

<p class="styled-text"><span style="font-size:40px;">W</span>elcome to <em>my</em> new website. This is  my <em>new</em> home on the web showcasing my work as a human geographer and adjunct professor.<br><br>I am an urban geographer with a background in environmental science doing research at the intersection of environmental, social, and racial justice by working with communities and combining quantitative and qualitative data analyses. I am also a dedicated educator teaching Geographic Information Science, human geography, public health, environmental studies as well as statistics and programming classes at the undergraduate and graduate level at CUNY and NYU, while also supervising undergraduate and graduate research.<br><br>Given my interdisciplinary background, I have collected a wide range of research experiences in the natural and social sciences. I have worked on and supervised research projects in the fields of GISc, geography, public health, urban studies, environmental science, earth science, and environmental studies. These research experiences have taught me how to utilize quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods in my research designs; how to work with large environmental and anthropogenic spatial data sets from many sources; how to conduct a large variety of statistical and spatial analyses with various software and programming languages such as R, ArcGIS Pro, Python, QGIS, and SPSS; how to work independently but also how to work with and manage a research team; and how to present my results in a professional environment. </p>
