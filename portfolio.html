The map shows food retailers in 1911 which consisted of mom-and-pop wet and dry grocers, butchers, and bakers. It also shows Black-owned grocery stores from 1920. The food retail data from 1911 comes from Newark's City Directory which only listed Wgite-owned businesses. In 1920, a Black newspaper published a Black business directory of New Jersey which lists Black-owned grocers in 1920. The graph shows the dramatic reduction of food retailers in Newark over the 20th century." height="500" width="800"><br></h1>

Only once the number of Black residents increased significantly  during the Thirst and Second Great Migration, Black residents became increasingly segregated into poor and dilapidated neighborhoods in Central Newark.

Food groups included in the index were 9 common fruits and 10 common vegetables, milk and eggs, whole grains, fish, lean meats, as well as frozen fruit, and vegetables. Each healthy food item received a score of one, and all scores were added up by store and avarged by store type. The color-coded table matches the barrier categories in the map and represents financial, access, transportation, individual choice, and knowledge-based barriers.
